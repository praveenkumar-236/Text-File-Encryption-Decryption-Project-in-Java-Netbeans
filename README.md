# Encryption-Project
Features of Encryption System :
1. GUI based file selection facility, to select the original file and the cipher text file.
2. Facility to save the converted Cipher Text into your PC and then send that file to the receiver.
3. Use any combination of password for encryption, but the same password has to be used while decrypting otherwise the decrypted contain will get altered by a huge margin, so any gaussing of the password will not do the trick.
4. Secure while transmitting over unsecure network like public network.
5. 100 % accuracy, as the original file and the final decrypted file are same.
6. Well tested.
